        <!-- In the last two sections, I inserted all images relating to the actors in a class so they all have the same characteristics. I also ensured all the paragraph texts
            looked identical, so I gave each paragraph relating to all the actors the same class and gave them the same css modifications so they match. As for the audio,
            I left them as they were because they needed not any changes. -->
