          <h2> SYNOPSIS </h2>
          <img class="float-image" src="image/movie art.jpg" alt="Image of Movie art" style="max-width: 100%">
          <p> Cecilia Kass is trapped in an abusive and violent relationship with a wealthy optics engineer and businessman named Adrian Griffin.
            One night, Cecilia drugs Adrian and makes her escape out of his highly secured home with the assistance of her sister, Emily.
          </p>
          <p> Cecilia seeks shelter at the house of his acquaintance, Detective James Lanier and his teenage daughter, Sydney.
            Two weeks after Cecilia's escape, Adrian commits suicide and leaves Cecilia 5 million dollars in his trust.
            Adrian’s lawyer and also brother, Tom, handles the arrangements. Cecilia suspects another presence in the house after several strange,
            lethal and life-threatening events and calls James, who assures her she is just traumatized.
          </p>
          <p> Cecilia believes that Adrian faked his death and that he is using his optics expertise to become invisible in order to torment her.
            She then works on how to prove that she’s being haunted by someone she can’t see.

      <!--As we can see above, I placed all images, and this will be noticed in the cast page as well, in a class and named them "float-image" because I'll be using
        the float element to allign the image next to the text. This will ensure, I use my available space effectively and improve the overall aesthetic of the page.
        As mentioned above (line 20), I placed all anchor elements in this section into a class. They will have the same appearance as the others.-->

      <!-- Next up is going to be the second section of the webpage. By using sematic elements, I am going to place all elements that have a relationship

      <!-- We can see from above that I inserted the anchor element into an anchor class as I said I would. I also inserted the video element/clip into a div element.
          I don't fully understand how to use a div element but I know it is used to differentiate other elements from one another. I used the div because I want to
          be able to freely adjust the trailer without it impacting the entire trailer section.-->
